# Hello!

My name is **Ursula** and I'm a **woman in tech**.
After a long search for my way in the technological jungle, I came across a programming language that caught my attention: **Python**. 

I started by getting to know the beast through **self-study**, before deciding that I'd really like to learn how to whisper in Python's ear. 

But the fields of application for this language are so vast that I had to choose a more restricted one to start with: **data science**.

So I took a **Fullstack course in Data Science & Engineering**. 

And here I am, ready to take my first steps into the snake cage... sorry, I meant : into the **world of data with python** as my travelling companion. When you put it like that, it doesn't sound so scary, does it?

In this Github repo, you'll find, over time, **exercises and projects carried out during my training**, but also, and above all, the **personal projects** I'll be working on.
